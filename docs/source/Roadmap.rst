Roadmap
================
A list of ideas with absolutely no resemblance of order!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I will put in some dates in a few days.
Currently the addon needs some work in the leaf object choosing department, I am aware of this and this is the first thing I will do.

* more accurate branch placement algorithm
* procedural shaders for tree bark
* procedural shaders for leaves
* multiple options for shaders and leaf models quality
* imperfections! broken branches and bark features
* new dynamic algorithm for making trees! (I know how to do it, will be really good.)
* a mixer section: have presets of settings resembling actual tree species, mix between them with sliders.
