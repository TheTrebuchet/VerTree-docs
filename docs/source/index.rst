===================================

**VerTree** is a Blender addon for all the environment artist out there. This addon enables the user to create *complex* trees *quickly*, whether it be for background or foreground. It is meant to give a basic or high quality tree mesh, depending on your needs. 
It can be used for quick drafting or almost complete asset creation.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.

A word from the developer.
-----------
This addon, like many, started as a personal project. In August 2022 when I became ultimately annoyed by some free Blender tree generation addons. It felt like the process of creating a tree was clumsy and time consuming. 
None of them had any connection to the real world so I neve knew if results were convincing. So I consumed copious amounts of forum posts, documentation and coffee to create **VerTree**. 
There are still lots of things to improve and expand on, the more I code the more ideas I have and I listed them in the :doc:`Roadmap` section. 
I won't make this addon public on github because I see it as my own personal challenge, but if you have any ideas and are willing to share please please please contact me at VerTree.dev@gmail.com.
