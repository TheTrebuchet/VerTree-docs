It can be used for quick drafting or almost complete asset creation.

A word from the developer.
-----------
This addon, like many, started as a personal project. In August 2022 when I became ultimately annoyed by some free Blender tree generation addons. I felt like the process of creating a tree was clumsy and time consuming. 
I never even knew if a tree I was creating had correct proportions and would resemble anything realistic. I consumed copious amounts of forum posts, documentation and coffee to create this software. 
There are still lots of things to improve and expand on, the more I code the more ideas I have and I listed them in the :doc:`Roadmap` section. 
I won't make this addon public on github because I see it as my own personal challenge, but if you have any ideas and are willing to share please please please contact me at treegen.dev@gmail.com.

How do I use it?
----------------
The addon is located in the n-panel, note that you have to be in object mode in order to access it.
